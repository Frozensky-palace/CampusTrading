# Campus Trading Platform - Backend Development Summary

## Project Overview
The Campus Trading Platform backend has been successfully completed. This backend system provides comprehensive APIs and services to support a campus-specific second-hand trading platform, enabling students to buy, sell, and trade various items with a focus on campus-scenario optimization.

## Architecture
The backend follows a modular Flask application structure with blueprints for different business domains:

```

## Core Modules Implemented

### 1. User Management
- Registration and authentication
- JWT token-based authorization
- User profile management
- Campus coin system integration
- Collection and favorites functionality

### 2. Product Management
- Item listing, editing, and deletion
- Category and tag support
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Image upload functionality

### 3. Transaction System
- Order creation and management
- Payment processing (virtual currency)
- Transaction history and tracking

### 4. Purchase Request System
- Request posting and management
- Matching with available items
- Notification system for matches

### 5. Price Comparison
- Web scraping functionality (BeautifulSoup integration)
- Comparative price analysis
- Market trend insights

### 6. Admin Panel
- User management
- Content moderation
- System monitoring

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Flask 2.3.2
- **Database**: MySQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database Migration**: Flask-Migrate
- **Security**: Passlib, Bcrypt for password hashing
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4, lxml
- **Configuration**: Python-dotenv for environment variables
- **API Structure**: RESTful design with consistent endpoints

## Key Features

### Security
- JWT-based authentication with token expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) support

### Data Management
- Relational database design with proper indexing
- Database migration support for version control
- Transaction atomicity for data integrity

### Performance
- Caching strategies implemented
- Efficient query optimization
- Proper error handling and logging

### Extensibility
- Modular design allowing for easy feature additions
- Consistent API patterns for frontend integration
- Clear separation of concerns

## Development Progress
The core backend functionality has been successfully implemented and is ready for integration with the frontend. All major modules are complete with comprehensive API endpoints covering all required business logic for the campus trading platform.

The system is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements such as real payment integration, mobile application support, and additional campus-specific features.

## Challenges
1. Different data source websites, resulting in inconsistent data specifications (refer to Solution 1)
2. Difficulties in storing data in databases (refer to Solution 2)
3. How to verify the data entered by users to ensure the validity and integrity of the data. You need to verify that the user name is unique, the complexity of the password, the email format, and so on.
4. How to handle errors, when user input errors or other problems occur, the need to handle errors appropriately, to provide users with useful error tips and feedback information

## Proposed Solution
1. Seek common ground and reduce differences
2. Use OCR Text Recognition

## Next Steps
1. Complete two ongoing issues
2. Based on our White Paper, guide and revise the development process
3. Creating Outline of technical report and produce a rough version of it.
